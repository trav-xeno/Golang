# Go var and function testing
this is just a simple app that shows the different basic types Go has. 
This app will print random numbers, random numbers between a range, and creates a random string. The seed for the random number generator is the current time.
The app will also perform the classic fizz buzz interview question funciotn.
There is also an example of searching a slice for a max value and using maps count how many times a wrod appears in a given text.
