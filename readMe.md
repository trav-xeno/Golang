# Go Lang
I have used the Go language in the past, but wanted to revisit it with the changes made since I learned a few years ago. So This is a repo that will contain many go lang based projects spanning from Web to commandline projects. 
The tour binary is an app to learn go writen by the go community.

## Go commands
Helpful commands to remember:

* cd go fmt  formats in current dir  
* cd go fmt ./...  format all current and all folders code udner 
* go get    updates and gets modules  
* go install  create executables binary in go bin folder if successful 
* go build    for executables mainly for testing it makes the result in the folder 
* go mod init   creates a new module , initializing the go module  example go mod init github.com/usernmae/repo
* go test  looks/runs testing files 
* go list -m all  lists module dependencies 
* go mod tidy removes all unsued dependencies
