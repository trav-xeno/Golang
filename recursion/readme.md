# Recusion practice
This will display some tali recursion examples such as: 
* fibonacci sequence
* classic Tower of Hanoi 
* Alexander Bogomolny’s UnOrdered Permutation Algorithm
The app will run once on each problem and then will take user input for each classic problem.

## Fibonacci sequence

example: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144 and so on.  
Each number is the sum of the previous two. 


## Classic Tower of Hanoi 

Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle. Traditionally, It consists of three poles and a number of disks of different sizes which can slide onto any poles. The puzzle starts with the disk in a neat stack in ascending order of size in one pole, the smallest at the top thus making a conical shape. The objective of the puzzle is to move all the disks from one pole to another pole with the help of third pole.
The puzzle has two rules:

1. You can’t place a larger disk onto smaller disk
2. Only one disk can be moved at a time

## Alexander Bogomolny’s UnOrdered Permutation Algorithm

The Alexander Bogomolyn’s algorithm is used to permute first N natural numbers.
Given the value of N we have to output all the permutations of numbers from 1 to N.

Examples:
Input : 2
Output : 1 2
         2 1

Input : 3
Output : 1 2 3
         1 3 2
         2 1 3
         3 1 2
         2 3 1
         3 2 1
